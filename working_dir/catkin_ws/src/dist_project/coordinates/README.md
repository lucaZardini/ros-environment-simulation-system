# CSV coordinates files

Here are the `.csv` files containing the spawn coordinates of the simulation entities.

- `robot_coordinates.csv`: Each line represents the initial spawn coordinates on the plane of a unicycle, editing this file before starting the simulation will change the number of deployed robots
- `tag_coordinates.csv`: Each line represents the initial spawn coordinates of a UWB tag on the ceiling of the simulated room.
- `target_coordinates.csv`: Each line represent the initial spawn coordinates on the plane of a target, this project was developed to only take into account one target per time. The possibility to deploy more than one target has been added as a potentiality for future projects.
